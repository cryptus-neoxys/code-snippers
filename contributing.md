## Style Guides for Git Commit Messages:memo:

### Here's a list of some good to have points, that can add more value to your contribution logs.

- Use the present tense (example: "Add feature" and not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood (example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Limit the first line (also called subject line) to 50 characters or less
- Capitalize the subject line
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what, why, vs, and how
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

For more detailed reference to the above points, refer here: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit.
